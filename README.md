# Introduction
The Companionly app aims to bridge the gap between individuals and mental health resources, offering a user-friendly, evidence-based platform to help users manage their mental well-being. With tools for mood tracking, mindfulness exercises, and crisis support, Companionly addresses the growing need for mental health interventions in an accessible, safe, and discreet manner. 


# Background and Literature Review
Mental health concerns such as stress, anxiety, and depression affect millions of people globally, yet access to professional support is often limited. Mobile apps have emerged as a vital tool to provide immediate, personalized support. Companionly aims to enhance these digital solutions by offering an intuitive interface, fostering community engagement, and offering timely crisis resources. Companionly utilizes the latest evidence-based materials for users. 

# Methods
The app was developed using the Spring Boot framework, integrating features such as:

Mood Tracker: A guided questionnaire that provides tailored resources based on user input.
Mindfulness Tools: Breathing exercises and meditation guidance.
Crisis Support: Immediate access to emergency resources.
Community Forums: Safe spaces for users to engage with others.
Rewards Program: Points system to encourage engagement.

# Discussion
Companionly empowers users to take control of their mental health while also offering a support system through community forums and professional resources. The app’s evidence-based content, real-time crisis management, and rewards system are designed to promote sustained engagement and emotional well-being.

Overall, planned objectives/goals were met. The Spring Boot framework with Thymeleaf allowed for a variety of features to be successfully implemented. Spring Boot has robust security mechanisms to ensure secure user logins and storage of sensitive information. 

There were challenges faced along with great successes. Creating various apps modularly worked well, but merging these into a larger app resulted in hours of research and learning to fix various bugs that would appear with each addition. Features that worked well locally behaved differently when deployed live to Google Cloud. 

# Results
Key features like the mood tracker and crisis support resources were developed and integrated into the app’s architecture. The platform’s modular structure allows for easy scalability and ensures a seamless user experience.

# Conclusion
By focusing on accessibility, scalability, and user-centered design, Companionly offers an effective solution to the mental health crisis. Future enhancements will include multilingual support and further integrations with mental health professionals. As discussed, Companionly is feature packed and will be very useful to the public, and even though challenges were faced, we are pleased with our product and hope you enjoy our presentation.
